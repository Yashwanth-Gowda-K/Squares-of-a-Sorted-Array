# Squares-of-a-Sorted-Array



## Problem Description ðŸ“˜

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, return an array of **the squares of each number**, also sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

### Example

Input: nums = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]
Output: [0, 1, 9, 16, 100]


## Approaches Implemented âœ…

- âœ… **Brute-force approach**: Square all elements and use a sorting algorithm (O(n log n)).
- âœ… **Two-pointer approach**: Efficient O(n) solution using two pointers to merge from both ends.

## Concepts Used ðŸ’¡

- List Comprehension
- Sorting
- Two-pointer Technique
- Time and Space Complexity Analysis

## How to Use ðŸš€

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Python file using any standard Python environment.
3. Compare different approaches by checking performance and readability.

## Why This Problem Matters ðŸ¤”

This problem is a great exercise for:
- Practicing array manipulation
- Understanding time complexity differences between sorting vs linear scan
- Gaining familiarity with two-pointer algorithms
